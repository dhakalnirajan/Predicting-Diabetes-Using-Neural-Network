## **Diabetes**

**[Diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes "Diabetes Mellitus")** is a _disease_ that _occurs_ when your _<u>[blood glucose](https://medlineplus.gov/bloodsugar.html "Blood glucose")</u>_, also called the _<u>[blood sugar](https://medlineplus.gov/bloodsugar.html "Blood sugar")</u>_, is **_<u>too high</u>_** in the body. Blood glucose is a <u><strong>main source of energy</strong></u> generating in the body to function. To _maintain the level of blood sugar_, the <u>**[Pancreas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas "Pancreas")**</u> in the digestive system _secrets an **[hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone "Hormone")**_ called <u>**[Insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin "Insulin")**</u>. Insulin helps blood sugar enter the body's cells so it can be used for energy. Insulin also signals the <u>**[liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver "Liver")**</u> to store blood sugar for later use. Blood sugar enters cells, and levels in the bloodstream decrease, signaling insulin to decrease too. When the level of Insulin is not produced sufficiently to neutralize blood sugar by some dysfunction, the sugar level increases with time and the disease develops.
